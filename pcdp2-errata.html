<ul>
<li>p. 90. p6 in formula (4.5) should be p4..6,
and similarly q6 in formula (4.6) should be q4..6.
<li>p. 92. The modification described in exercise 14
was later applied to the text,
so the exercise is no longer relevant.
<li>p. 130. Following line p5 of Udding's algorithm,
add the statement numGate1 \leftarrow numGate1 - 1.
<li>p. 139, ex. 8. #Buffer should be #buffer.
<li>p. 159, line -2. "If a reader is starved is must" should be "If a reader is starved it must".
<li>p. 160, line -2. The invariant should be eating[i] -> (forks[i]=2).
Clearly, forks[i]=2 is true initially, but eating[i] is false.
<li>p. 334, line p3 in the algorithm. "wait for all process" should be "wait for all processes".
